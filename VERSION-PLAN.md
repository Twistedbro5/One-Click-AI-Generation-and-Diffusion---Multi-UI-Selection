# Version 1.3 Enhancement Plan

## 1. Enhanced Error Handling

### 1.1 Directory Management
- [x] Add automatic creation of required directories: (Already implemented in Start-WebUI.bat for Automatic1111, Fooocus, and ComfyUI)
  - `config/fooocus/`
  - `outputs/fooocus/`
  - `models/`
- [x] Add error handling for directory creation failures (Basic handling exists in script)

### 1.2 Uncompleted Directory Management
- [ ] Add directory permission checks (Not yet implemented)

### 1.3 Completed Logging System
- [x] Implement structured logging to `logs/` directory (Basic error logging exists, e.g., docker-error.log)

### 1.4 Uncompleted Logging System
- [ ] Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) (Not fully implemented)
- [ ] Rotating log files (max 10MB per file, keep 5 files) (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Error reporting with stack traces (Not yet implemented)

### 1.5 Download Management
- [ ] Add checksum verification for downloaded models (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Implement retry mechanism for failed downloads (1 retry by default) (Basic retries exist for some operations)
- [ ] Add download resumption support (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Add disk space verification before downloads (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Add network connectivity checks (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Add Support for linking models from the other AI UIs, so the file structure is sound and the models are accessible by all UIs. (Not yet implemented)

## 2. UI/UX Improvements

### 2.1 Completed Interactive Setup
- [x] First-time setup wizard (Implemented via UI selection and prompts in Start-WebUI.bat)

### 2.2 Uncompleted Interactive Setup
- [ ] Model download selection (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Performance optimization options (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Network configuration (Not yet implemented)

### 2.3 Completed Status Monitoring
- [x] Real-time container status (Implemented with health checks and menu options)

### 2.4 Uncompleted Status Monitoring
- [ ] Resource usage (CPU/GPU/Memory) (Not yet implemented)
- [~] Download progress tracking (Mostly implemented)

### 2.5 Console Output
- [ ] Add color-coded output:
  - Green: Success messages
  - Yellow: Warnings
  - Red: Errors
  - Blue: Information
- [ ] Add progress bars for:
  - Model downloads
  - Container startup
  - File operations

## 3. New Features

### 3.1 Completed Model Management
- [x] Automatic model updates (Basic Docker pull for updates implemented)
- [x] Multiple model support (Supported via folder structure and UI selection)

### 3.2 Uncompleted Model Management
- [ ] Model version checking (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Model validation (Not yet implemented)

### 3.3 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] GPU memory optimization (Basic via Docker configs, but not advanced)
- [ ] Model caching (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Parallel processing options (Not yet implemented)

## 4. Documentation

### 4.1 Completed User Guide Update
- [x] Installation instructions (Updated in README.md and QUICK-GUIDE.md)
- [x] Basic usage (Updated with new menu and flow)
- [x] Troubleshooting (Enhanced with recent fixes)
- [x] FAQ (Partially updated)

### 4.2 Uncompleted Developer Documentation
- [ ] Plugin development guide (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] API documentation (Not yet implemented)
- [ ] Contribution guidelines (Not yet implemented)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Completed Infrastructure (1 week)
1. [x] Implement directory management (Completed in script)
2. [x] Add error handling framework (Enhanced in recent updates)
3. [x] Set up logging system (Basic logging exists)

### Phase 2: Completed User Experience (2 weeks)
1. [x] Implement interactive setup (UI selection and menus in place)
2. [x] Add status monitoring (Health checks and container menu)

### Phase 3: Uncompleted Advanced Features (3 weeks)
1. [x] Model management (Basic support exists)
2. [ ] Plugin system (Not started)
3. [ ] Performance optimizations (Partial)

### Phase 4: Completed Documentation & Testing (1 week)
1. [x] Write documentation (Recently updated)
2. [ ] Create tests (Not yet implemented)
3. [ ] Performance testing (Not yet implemented)
